  shortDescription: Migrate your application to run on Kubernetes
  description: |
    Migrating an application that wasn't written for k8s to run on k8s is
    both time consuming and error prone. There is also a steep learning curve
    when it comes to k8s. This plugin containerizes your application and
    creates k8s resources need to get your app running on k8s.
  caveats: |
    * Work in progress, improving all the time.
    * For some functionality a docker/container runtime and operator-sdk are needed.
